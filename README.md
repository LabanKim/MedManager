# MedManager
An android Application that reminds users to take their meds at regular intervals till they finish the meds.

# Directions For Use:
The user signs in using Google Accounts authentication and after a successful signin, is taken to the MainActivity which dispalys a list of all the medicines that the user is supposed to take.

If there are no meds, the user will go to the medicine addition screen by clicking the (+) floating action button. The user has to have internet connection enabled in the device for the addition operation to be successful.

The user can view their profile and edit their username.
